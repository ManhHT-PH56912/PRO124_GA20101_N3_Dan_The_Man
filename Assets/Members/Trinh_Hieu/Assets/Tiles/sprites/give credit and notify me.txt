All of these sprites have been ripped by using a program created entirely by me.



If use the sprites and/or the program for anything, please give credit.

If you use the sprites, please send me an e-mail.
If you get the sprites from anywhere else and use them, please send me an e-mail, too, because I would love to see what you make with them.
If you make use of the program for anything other than ripping sprites from Dan the Man, please send me an e-mail.

If you want to see the source code of the program or parts of it and didn't manage to get it by decompiling the program, send me an e-mail.
If you want to expand or otherwise modify the program, please notify me so we can find out at which point you don't need to give credit, anymore.
